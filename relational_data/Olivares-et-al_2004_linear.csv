Orientation of the m. masseter posterior,MP,"on the lateral plane, it was estimated as the angle between the distance ‘middle point of the dorsal border of the jugal fossa – post-condyloid process’ and the occlusal plane.",Olivares et al 2004
Orientation of the jugal fossa,JF,"on the lateral plane, it was estimated as the angle between the dorsal border of the fossa and the occlusal plane. The increase of this angle represents a more suitable orientation of the fossa for the origin of the m. masseter posterior.",Olivares et al 2004
Length of the masseteric rostral fossa,RF,between the anterior border of the fossa and the anterior border of DP4. It is an estimation of the disposition of the m. masseter medialis pars infraorbitalis. A long fossa indicates a more oblique orientation of the muscle and hence a greater involvement in generating propalinal movement of mandible.,Olivares et al 2004
Orientation of the m. masseter lateralis,ML,"on the transverse craneomandibular cross section of each articulated skull and mandible, it was estimated as an angle assessed trigonometrically on the basis of zygomatic breadth, jaw width and the distance ‘zygomatic arch – masseteric crest’. This angle was calculated as ML = tan arc ZMC/[(JW – ZB)/2]. It was assumed to estimate the degree of in- volvement of the muscle in the medial displacement of the mandible (see Fig. 1 in Greaves, 1980). An angle ≥ 90 ◦ implies no lateromedial force component for the m. masseter lateralis.",Olivares et al 2004
Orientation of the m. pterygoideus internus,PI,"on the horizontal plane, it was assessed as the angle between the line of action, ‘origin (pterygoid fossa) – insertion (pterygoid shelf)’, of the muscle, and the craneomandibu- lar sagittal axis. It was assumed that the more lateromedially oriented the muscle, the more medial movement of the mandible during mastication (Woods & Howland, 1979; Woods & Mckeen, 1989; Vassallo & Verzi, 2001).",Olivares et al 2004
Orientation of the pterygoid fossa,PF,"on the horizontal plane, it was measured as the angle between the lateral border of the fossa and the craneomandibular sagittal axis. It represents an additional estimation of the line of action of the m. pterygoideus internus.",Olivares et al 2004
Orientation of the m. pterygoideus externus,PE,"on the horizontal plane, it was assessed as the angle between the line of action, ‘origin (pterygoid plate) – insertion (medial surface of the condyle)’, of the muscle, and the craneomandibular sagittal axis. It was assumed that the more lateromedially oriented the muscle, the more medial movement of the mandible during mastication (Woods & Howland, 1979; Woods & Mckeen, 1989).",Olivares et al 2004
Orientation of medial border of the glenoid fossa,GF,"on the horizontal plane, measured as the angle of this border with respect to the sagittal axis of the skull. It was assumed that the disposition of the medial border of the fossa influences the main movement of the condyle in the fossa during mastication.",Olivares et al 2004
Orientation of the enamel band,AEB,measured surrounding the anterior lobe of the molars,Olivares et al 2004
Predominant orientation of the whole enamel band,EB,obtained as an average between the prevailing orientation of the enamel band in the anterior and the posterior lobes of the molars.,Olivares et al 2004
