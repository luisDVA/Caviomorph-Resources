Transverse diameter of the tibia,TDT,Width of the tibia at the diaphyseal midpoint.,Elissamburu and Vizcaino 2004
Shoulder moment index,SMI,Deltoid length of the humerus divided by the functional length of the humerus (DLH/HL × 100). This index is an indication of the mechanical advantage of the deltoid and major pectoral muscles acting across the shoulder joint.,Elissamburu and Vizcaino 2004
Humerus robustness index,HRI,Transverse diameter of the humerus divided by functional length of the humerus (TDH/HL × 100). It gives an indication of the robustness of the humerus.,Elissamburu and Vizcaino 2004
Epicondyle index,EI,"Epicondylar width of the humerus divided by functional length of the humerus (DEH/HL × 100). It gives an indication of the relative width available for the origin of the flexor, pronator, and supinator muscles of the forearm. It is considered a good indicator of fossoriality (Hildebrand, 1985; Lessa & Stein, 1992).",Elissamburu and Vizcaino 2004
Index of fossorial ability,IFA,Length of the olecranon process divided by the functional ulna length (OL/FUL × 100). This index gives a measure of the mechanical advantage of the triceps and dorso-epitrochlearis muscles in elbow extension. It is also considered a good indicator of fossoriality.,Elissamburu and Vizcaino 2004
Ulna robustness index,URI,Transverse diameter of the ulna divided by the functional ulna length (TDU/FUL × 100). It gives an indication of the robustness of the forearm and the relative width available for the insertion of muscles involved with pronation and supination of the forearm and flexion of the manus and digits.,Elissamburu and Vizcaino 2004
Gluteal index,GI,Distal extension of greater trochanter divided by the functional femoral length (DMT/FL × 100). It gives a measure of the mechanical advantage of the gluteus medius muscle and the velocity of femur extension.,Elissamburu and Vizcaino 2004
Femur robustness index,FRI,"Transverse diameter of the femur divided by the functional femoral length (TDF/FL × 100). It gives an idea of capacity to support body mass and to withstand vertical forces associated with velocity increase (Biewener & Taylor 1986; Demes et al., 1994).",Elissamburu and Vizcaino 2004
Tibial spine index,TSI,"Proximal tibia length divided by the length of the tibia (PT/TL × 100). It gives an indication of strength of the leg and the relative width available for the insertion site of the gracilis, semitendinosus and semimembranosus muscles and the foot flexors. It is important in the flexion of the leg during the first phase of the gait. Proximal insertion is related to greater speed during the initial propulsor movement (Elftman, 1929).",Elissamburu and Vizcaino 2004
Tibia robustness index,TRI,Transverse diameter of the tibia divided by the tibial length (TDT/TL × 100). It gives an indication of the strength of the leg and the relative width available for the origins of the muscles acting across the ankle.,Elissamburu and Vizcaino 2004
